# sweet.la
> js.la Dem Sugar!

Portland has [Donut.js](https://donutjs.club/), San Francisco has [Waffle.js](https://wafflejs.com/).
But watcha got, LA?

## About this app

I created this app for my "Building offline-first apps with Hoodie" talk at
[js.la](http://js.la/) in March 2017.

It’s is using [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) – The Offline First JavaScript backend.

But really it’s my attempt to put LA on the sweet.js map!

## Local Setup
